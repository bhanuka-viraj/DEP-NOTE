| What is `Atomicity`                         | ==Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit of work that either executes completely or not at all.==<br><br>Should not have to worry about the effect of incomplete transactions.<br><br>If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database returns to its state before the transaction began.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| What is <br>`Consistency`                   | ==Consistency ensures that only valid data is written to the database,== preserving the integrity of the database's constraints, rules, and relationships.<br><br>Transactions transform the database from one consistent state to another consistent state, ensuring that it adheres to all defined rules and constraints.<br><br>This property prevents the database from entering into invalid or inconsistent states due to incomplete transactions or violations of integrity constraints.<br><br>Ensuring property of the transaction is the responsibility of the user |
| What is `Isolation`                         | ==Isolation ensures that the execution of transactions concurrently does not interfere with each other.==<br><br>Each transaction appears to execute in isolation from other transactions, as if they were executed sequentially one after another.<br><br>Isolation prevents phenomena such as dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads, which can occur when multiple transactions access and modify the same data concurrently.                                                                                                                                |
| What is <br>`Durability`                    | ==Durability ensures that the changes made by committed transactions are permanent and persistent, even in the event of system failures or crashes.==<br><br>This property guarantees that the effects of committed transactions are durable and can be recovered in the event of system failures or crashes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| What is the reason to use <br>`ACID` system | Together, the ACID properties ensure that database transactions are executed reliably, consistently, and safely, maintaining data integrity and ensuring the correctness of the database despite failures or concurrent access by multiple users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
