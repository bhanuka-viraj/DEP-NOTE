| What is concurrency <br>In computing | In computer science, concurrency is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the outcome.<br><br>![[Pasted image 20240503133940.png]]<br>                                      |
| What is pallelism                    | Parallelism is the ability to execute independent tasks of a program in the same instant of time. Contrary to concurrent tasks, these tasks can run simultaneously on another processor core, another processor, or an entirely different computer that can be a distributed system. |
==What is the difference between serial schedules and serializable schedules==
(interview question)

| Serial Schedule                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Serializable Schedule                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Serial Schedules are those schedules in which execution of transactions takes places one by one. No other transaction is executed until the transaction that is currently executing has finished it’s execution.                            | Serializable schedule is a schedule that can be converted to serial schedule by exchanging position of operations of different transactions when the operations are of non-conflicting nature.                                                     |
| Serial Schedules are less efficient. This is because since only one transaction can be executed at once, so time is wasted when the executing transaction is performing Input/Output operations. The CPU sits ideal in that period of time. | These schedules can be a lot efficient than there equivalent serial schedule. This is because when one transaction is executing Input/Output operations other transaction can be executed in that period of time so CPU doesn’t have to sit ideal. |
