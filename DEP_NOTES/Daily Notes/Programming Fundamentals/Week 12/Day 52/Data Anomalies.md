| What does mean the <br>data anomolies   | Data anomalies are inconsistencies or errors in a dataset that can arise due to various reasons, such as poor database design, incomplete transactions, or concurrent access by multiple users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

What are the isolation level ?
