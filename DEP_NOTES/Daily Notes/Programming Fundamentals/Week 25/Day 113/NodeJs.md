| What is the source map in ts                            | When TypeScript is compiled to JavaScript, the code often <br>changes significantly due to the differences in syntax and the compilation process. This can make debugging difficult because the code you're seeing in the browser isn't the same as the original TypeScript code you wrote. Source maps help bridge this gap by allowing developers to view the original TypeScript code while debugging. |

| what are the type declaration files                     | **Type declaration files** in Node.js for TypeScript are files with a `.d.ts` extension that provide type information for JavaScript libraries or modules. These files allow TypeScript to understand the types used in a JavaScript library, which is essential when integrating JavaScript libraries with TypeScript projects.                                                                          |
