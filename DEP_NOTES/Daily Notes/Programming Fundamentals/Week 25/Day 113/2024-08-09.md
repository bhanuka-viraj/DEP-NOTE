| What is the error that can be arised with <br>`getSingleResulst()` | When return the multiple result it gives a `NoUniqueExcepiton`<br>(this is used only when the query returns a one value)<br><br>When return null it gives a `NoResult Excepiton` |

`NoResultException` =>

There is no record for customer id `C030`. So this return a `NoResultException`

When select the all student ->
When query have multiple results and use the `getSingleResult()` api for the query.This gives a error, because only allow to return a one value

What about this -> 

![[Pasted image 20240809114320.png]]
This might give a error if there are two customer with the same name asiri.
Should aware when query not using a primary key when use the `getSingleResult`. If there are two records that associate same name 'asiri', it means there are multiple results. This lead to a error.

`serFirstResult` =>

This is allowed to set the limit. The way use the limit is changed with the DBMS. When limit is used JQL not have to worry to change the query when us the difference DBMS. The best practice is doing this using JQL rather in DBMS

Q.What does the `setResult(2)` do
A. This set the offset  to the first two records. Skip the first two records

Q.What does the `setMaxResut(2)` do
A. This only return the two result from the start point

output -> 
First skip the first two records and only gives the two customer from the third one

Interview Questions =>

==Q==.What is the reason use `setFirstResult` in JQL rather `limit` in query embeding the code
==A== If limit embeded the code it need be changed when use the difference DBMS. Because difference DBMS handle limit in difference way

mysql use `limit`
postgre use `offset`

==Q.== When do filtering by `setFirstResult` or `setMaxResult()` is dong in the client side or the serve side.

==A.== Filtering is happen in the server side. Not in the client side. (Application)

==Q.== Do object that fetch from JQL are in persistance context 
==A.== Yes

Q.What is the reason to use transaction context when do the queries.
A. Queries can be done without a transaction context, but cannot be done other features like `delete` , `update` using the JPA if  the transaction  context is not being used



==Q. ==What is the reason for this error =>

==A== This doesn't return a entity class. This is the reason for error. When the result type is not specified in the `creaateNativeQuery()` , a entity class is not returned. 


Query Demo 7 => 

==Q. ==What is the reason to use Tuple here -> 

![[Pasted image 20240809122457.png]]

==A.== 
In Join Query it is required to get details about the both customer and Id, If Result Class is specified either `Customer.class` and `Order.class` it means it only gives the Customer or Order. There is not special class to get the both type in the same time. This is the reason to use `Tuple` Class for this case.

![[Pasted image 20240809122829.png]]

if the result class is Customer 

![[Pasted image 20240809122909.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240809122927.png]]

Now only customer data returns

==Note== -> Only Result class is added to the persistence context

refer this

When find the record about a customer it required be taken from the database. Since the ResultClass is `Tupple` either customer or order not in the persitence context. This is why need to execute a select query to get the customer



This is same for when get the order too.

![[Pasted image 20240809123352.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240809123408.png]]

Select Query have been executed for both Customer and Order because the Result type is Tuple
