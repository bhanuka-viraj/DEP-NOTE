Explain this Image ->
Web container do the handling HTTP request and response. EJB container do the handling business logics. As an example when order is saved, web container get the request for it and EJB container do the business logic handling and then again send the response to the web container. When business logics are contained in the EJB containers there are so many features to make process easier (features for database management, auto transaction.security....). It is ok to use business logic in web container but don't get those features unlike EJB. If it is also only used web container we can use our own architecture for the business logic. Also spring can be used as the EJB for business logic handling. 

This is web container =>
