1.Strongly Typed and Loosed Typed

This is a categorization of programming language according to how they consider about the day type. This is categorized based on the specification of the data type.

|  |  |
| ---- | ---- |
| Strongly Typed | A strongly typed language requires the specification of data types.<br><br>Strictly concern about the data type<br><br>this data type language check is data typed keep the data type same as when it is declared.<br> |
| Loosely Typed | A loosely typed language, or weakly typed language, does not require the explicit specification of data type.<br><br>Not  Strictly concern about the data type |

2.Statically Typed and Dynamically Typed

|  |  |
| ---- | ---- |
| Statically Typed | check the data type during the compilation |
| Dynammically Typed | check the data type during runtime |
JAVA  is Strongly typed , Statically typed intermediate language.

| What is the reason java and c# are used often <br>for enterprise apps | Because  both java and C# are strongly type and statically typed intermediate language. <br><br>When it is strongly typed. There will be no confusion in variable their data types.<br><br>When it is statically typed data types will be checked during the compile process. So it is not required to wait until the see the data type errors.<br><br>And also it is a intermediate language.<br><br>if language is doesn't have a compiler it means it cannot check the data type errors during the compile process. So it is a dynamically type |
| what is the reason typedScript is used over javascript                | typescript is strong and statically typed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
