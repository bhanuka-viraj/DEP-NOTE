If HEAD is not attached with a branch point(main in this case) the head is in the detached state. To make changes in the code both head and the group point should be attached. This is why the changes made during the detached state of the head are not included in the code. To see the past commits (snap-shots), Head need to be detached from the branch point

*command => git checkout SHA-value*
(HEAD detach with the branch point with this code)
