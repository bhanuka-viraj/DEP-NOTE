| What are the routers<br>in express js                 | Router is a mini app<br><br>This are small apps that are in the express app. Unlike <br>express app, these apps are not a server itself. But these<br>apps have all features ( like mapping registry) of the app <br>part of the express app.<br><br>These are called router, but named as controller in <br>coding<br><br>Router can't stand alone without a express app.<br><br>![[Pasted image 20240814144734.png]]            |
| What is the reason <br>to use Router in <br>express   | if the application is complex and cannot  handle the all<br>paths within the express app then go for the router apps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Is routers can be <br>traced as a <br>middle ware     | This can be traced in a middle ware to the stack                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| what are the benefit of <br>router-based architecture | - **Modularity:** Breaking down an application into smaller routers improves code organization and maintainability.<br><br>- **Reusability:** Routers can be shared across different parts of an application or even in other projects.<br><br>- **Scalability:** As the application grows, routers can be added or modified independently.<br><br>- **Testing:** Routers can be tested in isolation, making unit testing easier. |
