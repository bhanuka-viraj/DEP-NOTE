duck typing wiki => https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing#:~:text=In%20computer%20programming%2C%20duck%20typing,used%20for%20a%20particular%20purpose.

Java does not use duck typing. But programming languages like type script use duck typing. It means the java just check the shape of a type. Not the exact type.
As a example both User Entity and the UserTO has the same shape. So type script also consider the UserTo as the UserEntity
