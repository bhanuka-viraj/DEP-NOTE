In here mode is divided in to two part.
1. Database
2. Business Logic

This also can be show like layers. To do this should be a MVP instead of MVC.Because MVC has the connection between model and the view. Then this layer system cannot be show. This is should be a MVP rather MVC


To keep the web services (api) in the model another layer is added called api layer

Monolothic -> 

**Monolithic architecture** refers to a software design pattern where all components of an application are tightly integrated and operate as a single unit. In this architecture, different modules or functionalities of an application (like the user interface, business logic, and data access layer) are built as one unified codebase and deployed together.

Monolithic architecture is often suitable for smaller applications, startups, or projects where simplicity and quick deployment are more critical than scalability and flexibility. However, as the application grows, it may be necessary to consider migrating to a more modular or microservices architecture to address the limitations of a monolithic system.
