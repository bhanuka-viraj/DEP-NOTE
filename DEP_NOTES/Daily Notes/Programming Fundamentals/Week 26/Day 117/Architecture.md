| What is the software architecture<br>and application architecture | If the app is started with a right architecture <br>then it is called software architecture<br><br>if the app does not start with a architecture <br>but add a architecture later it is called application architecture |
| What is compound architecture                                     | Compounding the several architectures                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| what are the good quality<br>attributes of a good architecture    | -> Scalability (capability to scale the project)<br>-> Re-usability (less boiler plates)<br>-> Maintainability (should easy to fix bugs and maintain) <br>-> Testability (how easy to test)<br>-> Teamwork              |
| What is the responsibility<br>of a software architecture          | Create a compound architecture that fulfill  the <br>above quality attributes with the right balancing                                                                                                                  |
