| ==What is inheritance==                                     | If a derived (extended) new component ( sub component) adapt the members of the base component it is called the inheritance.<br><br>In Java these components are classes<br><br>if members in the super classes are not allowed to use in the sub class.That are not considered inherited (this is  why constructors, initializers and private members  are not considered as  inherited ) |
| What is the purpose of using inheritance                    | If a class need a features that already have been created in a another object then inheritance are used to get the features for the new object. and also this features can be modified (extend mean this)                                                                                                                                                                                  |
