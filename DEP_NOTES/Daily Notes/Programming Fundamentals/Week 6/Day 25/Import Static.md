| What is import static                                                           | `import static`Â is used in Java for importing static members (fields and methods) of a class directly into the current class, allowing to use them without prefixing with the class name. There are two common use cases in import static:<br><br>1. Single-Static Import: This imports a specific static member from a class.<br>2. On-Demand-Static Import: This imports all static members from a class.   |

The same way they are used in the own class. |
