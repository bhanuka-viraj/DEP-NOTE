When premio is assigned to the toyotaCar now compiler can cast it because it can understand the relationship between toyotaCar premio. To get the exact answer compiler has to send it to JVM<br><br>- The _RelationalExpression_ must be checked cast compatible with the _ReferenceType_ ([§5.5](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.5 "5.5. Casting Contexts")), or a compile-time error occurs.
