| ==What is the difference between <br>hiding and overriding==  | In overriding always execute the overridden method in the most sub class. For overriding it doesn't matter how the instance is being seen at. (which reference point of view).This done during the runtime. Compiler decide the methods to be run same as  the using hiding theory.                             |
