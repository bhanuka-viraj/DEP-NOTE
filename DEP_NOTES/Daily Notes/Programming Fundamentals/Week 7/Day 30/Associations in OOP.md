| Explain this code <br>with the composition                              | ![[Pasted image 20240312144600.png]]<br><br>When the parent is null there is no meaning for the childs. This is the composition. Tightly coupled.<br><br>Null point exception is encountered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| What is the reason<br>for this is a  aggregation                        | ![[Pasted image 20240312145851.png]]<br>In here student and teacher are created outside the institute. So even if the institute is become meaning less (null). Teachers and students are not become meaning less and unreachable. Even if the institute is meaning less teachers and students has meanings. <br><br>This is why aggregation is meant to be loosely coupled                                          |
| What is the better and why?<br>Composition or <br>aggregation           | Aggregation is better because it is loosely coupled<br> Easy for testing and maintaining. <br><br>Composition and Aggregation is depend on how we right the codes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
