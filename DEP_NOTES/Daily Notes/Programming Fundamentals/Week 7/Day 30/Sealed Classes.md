| ==What is the difference <br>between leaf class and the seal class== | leaf class does not allow to extends for anyone. Even the author cannot used these classes. But sealed classes allow to specify the permits class to give the permission to  extends                                                                                                                        |
| What kind of class can be<br>extended with the sealed<br>class       | sealed classes, final classes or non-sealed classes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| What is the condition for the sealed class                           | Sealed class should give the permits for the extends classes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| What would happens if <br>permit clause is removed in seal classes   | The class can be extended with the all classes in the same source file. But this class cannot be use with the other classes from the source file.<br><br>This is only applicable when all the classes are included in the same source file.                                                                 |
| Why sealed classes was<br>Introduced and when?                       | Sealed classes were introduced to mitigate the disadvantages of leaf classes. Because when leaf classes were used. It was not allowed to extend for anyone. This is the reason why sealed classes were introduced allowing predefine  classes that have ability to extend from the seal classes.<br>java 17 |
| ==What is the rule about the package and module <br>for the seal==   | All classes( sealed class and permitted classes) should be in the same package and the module                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
