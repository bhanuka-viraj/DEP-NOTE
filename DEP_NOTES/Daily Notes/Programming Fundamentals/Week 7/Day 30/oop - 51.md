There is no myMethod( ) in the class B.Then go for the class A try to find the myMethod( ). Class A got a myMethod but it is not accessible , because it private. This is the reason for the error. Because B doesn't have a any accessible method called myMethod( )                             |

Compiler determine the myMethod in the clas A to be executed. Since the myMethod is overridden JVM is execute the method in the most derived class. myMethod in the class C is executed.<br><br>output is 30 for the myMethod |
