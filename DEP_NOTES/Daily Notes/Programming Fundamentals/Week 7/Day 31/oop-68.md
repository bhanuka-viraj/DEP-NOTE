Abstract class cannot create instance it self

But when abstract class is  extended and if the abstract methods are implemented then abstract class and implemented abstract methods are involved to create the  object.

when a concrete class is implemented with the interface, interface go inside to the extended concrete class when instance is created. (blue print of the inherited object). There is no order when there are  several interfaces are available.
