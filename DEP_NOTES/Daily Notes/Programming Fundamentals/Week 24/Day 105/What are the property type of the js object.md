There are two type of property in the js object 
1.data / value
2.accessor

==Data / Value properties== -> The actual value stored in the property.

==Accessor ==-> do not store a value directly. Instead, they define functions to get and set a value. These properties use `getter` and `setter` functions.

if value get from the accessor property then it is worked as a getter and the if value is set the accessor property then setter is worked.
