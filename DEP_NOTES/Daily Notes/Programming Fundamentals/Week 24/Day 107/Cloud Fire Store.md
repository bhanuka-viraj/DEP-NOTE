| What is fire store                                                    | ->This is a data base system that is in fire base<br>-> This is not a relational data base management system<br>-> This is a No SQL DBMS ( Document Based)                                                        |
| What is a realtime<br>database management<br>system                   | Real time database management system allow to <br>subscribe. When values are changed clients can get <br>notifications. <br><br>fire store and real time database are  cloud base <br>database management system. |
| What is the difference <br>between DBMS and <br>reals time DMBS       | DBMS does not have that subscription feature. Client <br>only get a snapshot of a database in certain time.                                                                                                       |
