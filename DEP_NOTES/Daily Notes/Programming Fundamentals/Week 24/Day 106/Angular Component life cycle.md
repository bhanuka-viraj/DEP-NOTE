-> Static Initializers execute only once(if component is used several time, but initializer is worked only in first time.)

-> After stages 1 -> 8 component is ready to use.

2,4,6 and 8 are worked everty a changes is detected in component. This is called change detection life cycle

[[Template Reference Variable]]

Q. What is the difference between content child and view child

![[Pasted image 20240731180700.png]]
A. Both use for the template reference variables. `@ViewChild("h1")` is work with ui element. `@ContentChild(crayz)` is worked when the content are changed 

How to access the all element when there are several content elements and view elements 

this not working ->
![[Pasted image 20240731194535.png]]
This only allow to access to the first element
