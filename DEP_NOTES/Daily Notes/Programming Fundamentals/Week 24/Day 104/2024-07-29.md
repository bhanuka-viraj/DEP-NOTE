As the user visits new pages, for example by <br>clicking links, those new pages are added to the session history. The user can also move back and forth through the history using the browser's "Back" and "Forward" buttons.                                                                                                             |

It provides a consistent root path for relative links and resources within a web page or application, ensuring that all relative URLs are interpreted correctly regardless of the current location or directory structure of the document.<br>   |
This is the use of base url `<base href"/assets/>`
