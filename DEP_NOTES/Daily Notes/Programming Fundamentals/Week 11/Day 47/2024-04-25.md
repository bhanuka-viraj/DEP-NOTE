| How does the client server <br>architecture works                 | Sockets are required to connect with the networks( server)<br><br>clients are connected with the server. sockets are <br>used to keep the connection between client and<br>server.

Remote sockets.<br><br>Server sockets is used as the common sockets <br>that visible for the all client. <br><br>first client connected to the server socket and then <br>connection is diverted creating a local socket.
