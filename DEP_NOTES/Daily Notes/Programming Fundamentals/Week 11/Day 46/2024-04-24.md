| What is ARP<br>message                                                  | ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a networking protocol used to map an IP address to a physical MAC (Media Access Control) address. When a device on a local network needs to communicate with another device, it first checks its ARP cache to see if it already has the MAC address of the destination IP address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
