First AppInitializer.java compile into AppInitializer.class|
if there is no constructor included in implicitly then explicitly add the default constructor. In here a constructor has been added. 

But in first line there is no super ( ) invocation or this ( ) invocation. Then is added to the  very first line of the constructor.   

Then SystemLoader laod the byte code into the method area in form of a object

Now loading is done

Next go for the linking process => 1. Verification 2.Preparation 3.Resolution
in preparation static variables assigned with the default values.

int x is assigned to 0;

Next go for the initialization of the class object
In this process static variables are initialized and static initializers are executed.

execute the first static initializer and print the 
=> "AppInitializer class object is being initialized"

then initialized the x with value of 10;

Initialization is over and now run the main method of the class object.

when run them main method ->
first print the "main ( )"
then going to execute the new AppInitializer (5);

first create the instance of AppInitializer in heap filtering the instance variables and methods and initialzers. And also in this process instance variables are assigned to their default values.
