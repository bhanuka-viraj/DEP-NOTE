| What are the process<br>of execution a file | There are several steps in a process of execution a classs<br><br>1. Loading<br><br>2.Linking<br><br>a. Verification =><br>b. Preparation =><br>c. Resolution =><br><br>3. Initialization<br><br>                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 1. Loading                                  | The first step in executing a class is loading it into the JVM in form of Object                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 2.Linking                                   | After a class is loaded, it undergoes linking, which consists of three substeps:<br><br>a. Verification =><br>JVM verifies the bytecode of the class<br><br>b. Preparation =><br>==Static variables in the byte codes are assigned to the defaults values==<br><br>c. Resolution =><br>Symbolic reference in the byte code are replaced with the direct reference |
| 3. Initialization                           | Once the class is loaded and linked, it undergoes initialization<br><br>==In here static variables are initialized and static initializers are executed.==                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| What after the all three process            | After all three process now the blue print is ready to use. If there is the main method , then it run and main frame is created in the stack.(execution context)<br><br>If one process is failed to complete then stop the process.                                                                                                                               |
