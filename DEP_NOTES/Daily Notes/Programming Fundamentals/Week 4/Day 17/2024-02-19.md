| What is data structure              | Intentional arrangement of data in ==memory==<br><br>this should be done in the memory. Not in the hard disk                                                                                                            |
| Why data structure                  | To store data an retrieve data easily                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| What is array<br>in data structure  | Array is the simplest data structure model                                                                                                                                                                              |
| What are the two <br>type of arrays | 1) Fixed arrays => capacity is fixed<br>2) Dynamic arrays =>capacity can be expanded<br><br>==Java language only have the built in support with fixed arrays. But Java SE library has support for the dynamics arrays== |
