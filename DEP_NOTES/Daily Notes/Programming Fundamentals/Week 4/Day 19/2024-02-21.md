| [[Linear Search]]      | This is the simplest search<br>                                                                                                        |
| [[Selection Sort]]     | There are two way to do this. Using min and max<br>                                                                                    |

| [[Insertion Sort]]     | This can be used both linear search and binary search                                                                                  |
