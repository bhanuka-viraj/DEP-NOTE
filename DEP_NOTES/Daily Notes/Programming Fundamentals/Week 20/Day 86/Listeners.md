What is the purpose of using listners =>

Listeners in servlets are used to monitor and respond to various events in a web application's lifecycle. They provide a way to execute code when certain events occur, such as when a servlet context is initialized or destroyed, when a session is created or invalidated, or when a request is received or completed. By using listeners, developers can manage resources, perform logging, enforce security, or implement any other necessary functionality that needs to be triggered by specific events.
