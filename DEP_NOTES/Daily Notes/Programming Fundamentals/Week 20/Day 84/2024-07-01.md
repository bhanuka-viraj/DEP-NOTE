| There is not time difference between request. Because class objects are alreday loaded during the deployment                                                                  | In Lazily, the class object is initialized with the first request. Then first request take  higher time  than other |
| Since eagrly load the class object during the deployment it require higher heap memory. When use eagerly it takes<br>higher heap memory even servlets haven't get any request | In lazily class object are only get the memory from the heap only if it get requests                                |

Developer should need to be decide between eagrly load or lazily laod.
