| Is it a good practice <br>to return values<br>and throw exception within<br>the finally block | It is not a good pracitce to return and throw values within the finally block<br><br>Because when there is a return or throw value  in a finally block other exceptions  and returns are covered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| What is the problem of <br>using finally                                                      | When using the finally some time real return or exception is covered by the return or exception of the finally. This could change the meaning of the code and some time leads to a difficulty to find out the actual exception of the code. <br><br>Those things need to be considered when using the final block with the try statement.<br><br>Try with resources statement was introduced to mitigate the those difficulties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
