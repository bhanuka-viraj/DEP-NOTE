JVM is given a memory from RAM by OS. (from the segmentation => stack, heap,bss, data and Text). Text get the machine code form the hard disk that need to run the JVM. This is a machine code and understandable for processor. OS thread (t1) and Os thread (t1) context execute the instructions in machine code in JVM using processor. 
JVM itself a platform like a operating system. JVM manage and structure  the Heap memory which was given by the segmentation. Heap memory is divided in to two parts.One part use JVM it self and  other part is used to store the java application. That heap is structured like below.

Byte code is taken from the hard disk and keep it in the method area (class loader load the byte code from the hard disk). JVM needs to create a Java Thread. JVM cannot creates a Java thread itself. Then JVM ask from OS to create a OS thread and then Java thread is created using the OS thread. Os thread(t2) is thread that is used to create the java thread. Java thread has it's own PC register for the execution. (same as the thread context has it's own PR ) Byte code is not understandable for the processor and the JIT (Just In Time) compiler decode the byte code in to the machine code and it is stored in the JIT cache. (This is stored in the other part of the heap in JVM) Then OS thread (t2) context gives the decoded machine codes to the processor.

OS threads cannot execute the byte code itself. Because they can only execute the machine code. And also JVM cannot create thread itself and has to ask it from the OS. But Java threads can execute the  byte code. This is the reason why intermediate language perform less than the compiler language.
