| How JVM manage the <br>Memory , What happen <br>when the java application<br>is run | When a java application run, the operating system give a memory space from ram to the JVM. Then JVM organized this given space. JVM use some space itself and and manage the free space for java applications.(Same as operating system does for the application and itself)  <br>  <br>Then thread is created by the JVM. Each JVM thread has a private JVM stack, created at the same time as the thread.This is called the call stack. Thread always associated with the stack.  <br>  <br>A JVM stack stores frames.When a methods is invoke, execution context is created in the stack. Firstly thread invoke the main method (This thread is called the main thread) and then others frames are created when the methods are invoked.Frames follow the FILO (First In Last Out) and LIFO (Last In First Out) design. Current running methods is store on the top of the stack. When there is no frame to execute then thread close the stack.There should be at least one stack when a java program is run.  <br>  <br>To create a thread it should be called explicitly.  <br>  <br>Processor do the execution and ram keep the code in it's memory. Threads coordinate access to memory and CPU resources facilitating the execution of code and data stored in RAM by the processor.  <br>  <br>  <br>![[Pasted image 20240218161726.png]]<br><br>This is how stack stores the frames  <br><br><br>  <br>![[Pasted image 20240218161811.png]]<br><br>This is how OS give the memory form RAM to JVM and how JVM manage it.  <br><br>![[Pasted image 20240218161847.png]]<br>  <br>This is the expand of the memory of a java application that is given by the JVM |

| What is the relationship between thread and the stack                               | thread is associate with the stack, thread is created by the JVM. Every thread has stack , which is created the same time when the thread is created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| What happens there is no frame in the stack                                         | When there is no frame to execute then thread closed the stack.
