Conversion and Contexts

|  | Conversion and Contexts |
| ---- | ---- |
| [[Assignment Contexts]] | _Assignment contexts_ allow the value of an expression to be assigned ([§15.26](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.26 "15.26. Assignment Operators")) to a variable; the type of the expression must be converted to the type of the variable.(this is also valid for constants)<br><br> |
| [[Casting Contexts]] | _Casting contexts_ allow the operand of a cast expression ([§15.16](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.16 "15.16. Cast Expressions")) to be converted to the type explicitly named by the cast operator.<br><br>This is not only use for narrowing conversion. It is just use to convert the data type explicitly. |
| [[Numeric Contexts]] | _Numeric contexts_ apply to the operands of arithmetic operators, array creation and access expressions, conditional expressions, and the result expressions of `switch` expressions. |
| [[String Contexts]] | String contexts apply only to an operand of the binary `+` operator which is not a `String` when the other operand is a `String`. |
| [[Method Invocation Contexts]] | _Invocation contexts_ allow an argument value in a method or constructor invocation to be assigned to a corresponding formal parameter. |
