Then double type and memory location going to evaluate. But there is no context type to do that. This why it is encountered a error.<br><br>second sop => end result of x and 10 is double. Then double type and string type going to evaluate and end result is string. Then string type and memory location going to evaluate and end result is string. <br>Memory location is converted into string using toString() method.<br><br> |
