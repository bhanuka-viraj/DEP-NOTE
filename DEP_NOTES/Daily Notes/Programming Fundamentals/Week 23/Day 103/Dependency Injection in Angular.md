Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that involves providing dependencies to a class rather than the class creating them itself. In the context of services, this means injecting a service into a component or another service.

### Types of Dependency Injection

- Constructor Injection
- Setter Method Injection
- Interface through injection
- Property Injection

Angular supports Constructor and Property Injection
