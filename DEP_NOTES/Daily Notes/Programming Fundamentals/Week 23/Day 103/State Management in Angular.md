| What is `Service` in<br>angular    | In Angular, a service is a class that provides reusable functionalities and can be shared across different components<br><br>=> To share data(state), logic among components <br>=> To isolate the logic communicating with the  back-end, from the component<br><br>![[Pasted image 20240727154037.png]]<br>                                                                                  |
| What is prop <br>Drilling          | Prop drilling is a term used to describe the process of passing data ( properties ) through multiple levels of components in a component hierarchy to come to a common ground ( parent ). While Angular does have mechanisms to handle data flow, it can become cumbersome and inefficient when dealing with complex component structures.<br><br>![[Pasted image 20240727154143.png]]<br><br> |
| What is Redux                      | Redux is a popular JavaScript library for managing and centralizing application state. It's often used in conjunction with frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue to build complex and scalable applications.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
