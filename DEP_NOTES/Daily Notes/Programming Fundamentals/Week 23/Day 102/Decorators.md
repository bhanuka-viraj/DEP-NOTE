Decorators do the same feature as annotation in java.
This is still a experimental feature in Ts. So need enable in the tsconfig.json.

Unlike in java decorators are not a special kind of interface. In Ts classes are functions. 

Decorators can be used with the classes, methods, attributes in classes and parameters of methods.
