These are the attributes during the conceptual phase

|                           | Type of attributes in ERD                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Multi Value<br>Attributes | attributes that can have multiple values for a single entity instance. Unlike atomic attributes, which hold a single value, multi-valued attributes can hold a set of values.                   |
| Atomic Attibutes          | Cannot be further subdivided into smaller parts. They are considered to be the most basic form of data that an entity can have, representing single, indivisible pieces of information.         |
| Derived<br>Attriubtes     | attributes whose values are calculated or derived from other attributes in the database rather than being stored directly.                                                                      |
| Composite Attribute       | attributes that can be divided into smaller sub-parts, each of which represents a more basic attribute with its own meaning.                                                                    |
| candidate key             | that uniquely identifies each record in an entity. Each candidate key can uniquely identify an entity instance, but only one is chosen as the primary key.<br><br>candidate for the primary key |

In the logical state those attributes need be converted to the atomic attributes
