`ngFor` provides several local variables that can be used within the loop, such as:

- `index`: The index of the current item.
- `first`: A boolean indicating if the item is the first in the collection.
- `last`: A boolean indicating if the item is the last in the collection.
- `even`: A boolean indicating if the index is even.
