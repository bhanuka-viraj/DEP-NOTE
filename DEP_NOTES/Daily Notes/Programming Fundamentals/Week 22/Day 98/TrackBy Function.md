The `trackByFunction` in Angular's `*ngFor` directive is an optimization technique used to improve the performance of your application when dealing with lists of items. Here's a detailed explanation:

Note -> In default trackby is checked using the value of the array.

**What it Does:**

By default, `*ngFor` tracks items in a collection by their **values** (values of the array). This works well for simple cases, but if you have a complex data structure where objects are stored in an array, the object references might change even though the data itself remains the same, `*ngFor` might unnecessarily re-render the entire list, leading to performance issues.

The `trackByFunction` allows you to specify a custom function that tells Angular how to uniquely identify each item in the collection. This function should return a unique value for each item that remains consistent even if the object reference changes.

**Benefits:**

- **Improved Performance:** By using `trackByFunction`, Angular can efficiently update only the specific elements that have actually changed in the list, instead of re-rendering everything. This can significantly improve performance, especially for large lists.
- **Reduced DOM Manipulation:** Minimizes unnecessary DOM manipulation, which can be expensive for the browser.
