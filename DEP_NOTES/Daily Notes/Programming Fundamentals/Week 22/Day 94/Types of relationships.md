**Unary Relationship**:

- **Definition**: A relationship where an entity is related to itself. This is also known as a recursive relationship.
- **Example**: In an employee database, if each employee can have a supervisor who is also an employee, the "supervises" relationship is unary.

**Binary Relationship**:

- **Definition**: A relationship between two different entities.
- **Example**: In a school database, the relationship between "Student" and "Course" entities where students enroll in courses is a binary relationship.

**Ternary Relationship**:

- **Definition**: A relationship that involves three different entities.
- **Example**: In a hospital database, consider a scenario where a relationship involves a "Doctor", "Patient", and "Treatment". Each instance of the relationship might record which doctor administered which treatment to which patient.

**N-ary Relationship**:

- **Definition**: A relationship that involves more than two entities. Ternary relationships are a specific type of N-ary relationship where N = 3.
- **Example**: For an N-ary relationship where N=4, consider a "Research" relationship involving "Professor", "Student", "Project", and "Funding Source".
