==What is the iterator protocol ->==

**The iterator protocol** defines a standard way to produce a sequence of values (either finite or infinite), and potentially a return value when all values have been generated.

An object is an iterator when it implements a **`next()`** method with the following semantics:

[`next()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#next)

A function that accepts zero or one argument and returns an object conforming to the `IteratorResult` interface (see below). If a non-object value gets returned (such as `false` or `undefined`) when a built-in language feature (such as `for...of`) is using the iterator, a [`TypeError`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError) (`"iterator.next() returned a non-object value"`) will be thrown.

All iterator protocol methods (`next()`, `return()`, and `throw()`) are expected to return an object implementing the `IteratorResult` interface. It must have the following properties:

[`done`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#done) Optional

A boolean that's `false` if the iterator was able to produce the next value in the sequence. (This is equivalent to not specifying the `done` property altogether.)

Has the value `true` if the iterator has completed its sequence. In this case, `value` optionally specifies the return value of the iterator.
