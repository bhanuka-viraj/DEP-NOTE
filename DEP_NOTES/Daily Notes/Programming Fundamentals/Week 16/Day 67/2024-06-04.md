How does the `for... of`  works ->

This is internal work of `for (const vlaue of employee) console.log(value)`
![[Pasted image 20240604131108.png]]

explanation -> first get the iterator of the employee calling the `symbol.iterator()`. 

iterator object has the function called next ( ) which return a iteration result.
Iteration result has the two properties called `done` and `value`

Then iterate the iterator calling the next() method of the iterator until the done property return the false.
