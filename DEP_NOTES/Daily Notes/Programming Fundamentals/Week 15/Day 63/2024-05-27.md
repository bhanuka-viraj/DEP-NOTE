explain this ->(what happen when the col size is not defined for a specific width size)
![[Pasted image 20240527124622.png]]

when the width is greater than 992px ->

when the width is less than 992px ->
![[Pasted image 20240527124806.png]]
when the col is not defined in some width then they act as row

==what happen when the row has a more than 12 columns ->==

```HTML
<div id="container-3" class="container-fluid">  
    <div class="row">  
        <div class="col-lg-6">1</div>  
        <div class="col-lg-3">2</div>  
        <div class="col-lg-6">3</div>  
    </div></div>
```

(refer the light blue area)
create a new row and then put the rest of the col.In here new row is created adding 6 columns in it

Note -> In default `col-12` is added implicitly as the default col size. This means if other col values are not defined this work as default. This is the reason that is showed the column as row when the col size is not defined in the above case.
