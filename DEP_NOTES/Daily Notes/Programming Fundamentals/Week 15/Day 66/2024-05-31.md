##### Functions

|                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| How does the <br>function behave for <br>their delclarations<br>`var` | The `var` declaration that have been made withing the <br>functions are only accessible withing the function. <br>A separate block is created for the functions |
```js
function mhMethod() {  
    var z = 20;  
    console.log(z);  
  
    {  
        let m = 40;  
        var k = 30  
        console.log("k", 30);  
        console.log("m", m);  
    }  
    console.log("m", m); // not accessible from the outside  
    console.log("k", 30);// not accessible from the outside  
}
```

##### Environment

![[Pasted image 20240531131003.png]]

Script -> Script is the entire thing within the global.If there are lots of files are linked, it is treated as the one script (file) by the Js engine.The link order of the files are important. Js Engine see the all script as the one script

Module -> Module is the another context. It is same concept like class in java.One Module cannot access the another without importing. If there are several modules they are treated separately by the engine unlike script. This is also created withing the global

==What is the reason to introduced  module ->==
There were lots of conflicts in scripts. When several js files created and linked, they are treated as the one script. So it is not allowed to create the function or variables with same name in two difference files. Modules were introduced to prevent this. 
![[Pasted image 20240531130936.png]]

Script and Modules ->
![[Pasted image 20240531130852.png]]
Script can access it's mutual script, but module cannot access to it's mutual modules but can access to the any script.

refer this  -> add git link of 04-ecma-lang-04

![[Pasted image 20240531130806.png]]

==How does the functions are access the variables of the outer functions ->==

Because the function environment record is linked to it's outer environment. Function cannot access directly access to the properties of the outer functions. But it can access to the properties of the outer function link through the outer environment

`var` deceleration of the functions are not hoisted with the global environment

##### Variable Declaration Statement
```js
let myLet = 10;  
const constant = 10;  
const const1; // const cannot declare without an initializer;  
let myLet1;  
var myVar1;
```

##### Expression Statement

Any expression can be considered as the expression statement in java script 
```js
/*Expression Statement*/  
10+5;  
true;  
false;  
{};  
{} + 100;
```

##### If statement

what is the difference between if statement in java and java script

in java the if require a boolean expression ( expression that gives true or false)
In JavaScript if require anything that can be converted to a truthy or falsey

```js
if (10) {  
    console.log("Truthy");  
}  
  
if ("ijse") {  
    console.log("Truthy")  
}
```


##### Iteration Statement
In js iteration statement can be created using the truth and falsy values as the condition

how this loop works

```js
let i = 5;  
while (i--) {  
    console.log(i);  
}
```

when `i` become zero this loop is stopped, because condition become falsey

==`for...in` -> introduced in 5.1==

| What is the reason to<br>user for... in | to iterate enumerable properties of any object or iterate indexes of array-like objects |

syntax ->
```js
for(const propety in object reference){

}
```

example -> objects
```js
let employee = {  
    id: 'E001',  
    name: 'Kasun Sampath',  
    address: 'Galle',  
    print() {  
        console.log(this.id, this.name, this.address);  
    },  
};  
  
for (const prop in employee) {  
    console.log(prop);  
}

//out put -> id name address print


//when enumerable set false

let employee = {  
    id: 'E001',  
    name: 'Kasun Sampath',  
    address: 'Galle',  
    print() {  
        console.log(this.id, this.name, this.address);  
    },  
};  
  
Object.defineProperty(employee, 'print', {  
    enumerable:false  
})  
  
for (const prop in employee) {  
    console.log(prop);  
}

//output -> id name adress
// not iterate enumerable flase are iterated
```

example -> arrays 
```js
for (const prop in employee) {  
    console.log(prop);  
}  
  
let myArray = [10, 20, 30, 40];  
for(const index in myArray) {  
    console.log(index, myArray[index]);  
}
```



==`for...of` -> Introduced in 6==

```js
for(const vlaue of sync iterable ref){

}
```


==`for...await..of` ==

```js
for await(const value of async/sync iterable ref){

}
```

==`for...of await..`==
```js
for(Const value of await promiseRef){

//when promise is resolve, sync iterable should be return

}
```

==`fow await...of..await`==

```js
for await(const value of await async/sync of await async/sync iterable promise ref){

}
```


Note ->
All async statements should be in the async context or top-level module
