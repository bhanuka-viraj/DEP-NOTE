### SELECT STATEMENT
#### ORDER BY

Explain this statement (order by part)
`SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY dob,name;`
first order by dob. If there are some rows with the same dob then those rows are order by the name.

#### IN

`IN (value, value, value)`
Do this example->

```SQL
CREATE TABLE customer(  
    id CHAR(5) PRIMARY KEY ,  
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL ,  
    city VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL ,  
    district VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL ,  
    province VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL ,  
    contact CHAR(11) UNIQUE NOT NULL  
);
```

add some values to this table

1.Find the amount of customer more than 2 in a same province

```SQL
SELECT province FROM customer GROUP BY province HAVING COUNT(id)>2;
```

2.Find the all amount of the customer from the same province and district

```SQL
SELECT province,district,COUNT(id)  FROM customer GROUP BY province,district;
```

3.Find the amount of the customer from the same province and district where province has more than two customers

```SQL
SELECT province,district, COUNT(id)  FROM customer  
GROUP BY province,district HAVING province IN (SELECT province  
                                               FROM customer  
                                               GROUP BY province  
                                               HAVING COUNT(id)>2);

##### LIKE 
`[NOT] LIKE pattern`
what is the difference between below queries

```SQL
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE name LIKE '%mal Silva'; 
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE name LIKE '_mal Silva';

```

% -> for 0..* (zero or many)
_ -> for 0..1 (zero or 1)
##### SIMILAR TO

`[NOT] SIMILAR TO Pattern`

in here regex is used as the pattern

`What are the customer name that starts from 'M'`
```SQL
SELECT * FROM customer WHERE name SIMILAR TO  'M[A-Za-z ]+';
