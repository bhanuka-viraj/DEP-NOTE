| What is the purpose of<br>using core framework        | This do the inversion of control using the factory framework<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| What is the purpose <br>of using `AppContext`         | App context is a advanced factory that have ability to <br>create necessary dependencies and inject them                                                                                                                                                                |
| What is the use of <br>app config                     | app config provide the necessary information for the <br>app context to create the dependencies                                                                                                                                                                         |
| what is the use of <br>`@ComponentScan` <br>decorator | This denote the class is a app config                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| What is the use of <br>`@Component` decorator         | This denote that class is dependable for the app context<br><br>This is eligible to create a instance (bean) when create <br>the app context. Those instance are stored in the app<br>context. These instances can be accessed using the <br>token from the app context |
| What is the use of <br>`@Autowired` <br>              | This is used to define the which instance is returned <br>from the factory                                                                                                                                                                                              |
