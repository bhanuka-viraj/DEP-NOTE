`getReference( )` is lazy loading and `find()` is eager loading. `find()` hit the database just in time and `getReferece( )` hit the table when it required to use the detail

In JPA, both `find()` and `getReference()` are methods used to retrieve entities from the database, but they have distinct differences in how they operate and their intended use cases:

==getReference( ) is used when we exact know the id is there in the database==

### `find()`

1. **Eager Loading**:
    
    - The `find()` method retrieves an entity instance by its primary key and fully initializes it immediately. It performs an immediate database access to load the entity.
2. **Entity State**:
    
    - The returned entity is in a managed state, meaning it is fully loaded and can be interacted with directly.
3. **Usage**:
    
    - `find()` is used when you need the complete entity with all its fields initialized and ready for use.
4. **Null Handling**:
    
    - If the entity with the specified primary key does not exist, `find()` returns `null`.

### Example:

`Employee employee = entityManager.find(Employee.class, employeeId);`

### `getReference()`

1. **Lazy Loading**:
    
    - The `getReference()` method retrieves a reference to an entity instance. This reference is a proxy that may not access the database until a method is invoked on it. The actual data is loaded lazily when needed.
2. **Entity Proxy**:
    
    - The entity returned by `getReference()` might be a proxy object. Accessing fields or methods on this proxy will trigger a database access to load the actual entity data.
3. **Usage**:
    
    - `getReference()` is useful when you need a reference to the entity, but you don't need to access its data immediately. It is often used in performance optimization scenarios where deferring the loading of the entity is beneficial.
4. **EntityNotFoundException**:
    
    - If the entity with the specified primary key does not exist, `getReference()` throws an `EntityNotFoundException` when the proxy is accessed.

### Example:

`Employee employee = entityManager.getReference(Employee.class, employeeId);`

### Key Differences

- **Loading Behavior**:
    
    - `find()`: Loads the entity immediately.
    - `getReference()`: Loads the entity lazily, potentially returning a proxy.
- **Return Value When Entity Does Not Exist**:
    
    - `find()`: Returns `null`.
    - `getReference()`: Throws `EntityNotFoundException` when accessed.
- **Use Case**:
    
    - `find()`: When you need the entity data immediately.
    - `getReference()`: When you only need a reference and want to defer loading.

### When to Use Each

- Use `find()` when you need the complete entity and its data immediately.
- Use `getReference()` when you need a reference for operations like setting a relationship or deleting an entity without needing its data upfront, which can help improve performance by delaying the database access.

What does mean the proxy ->

In the context of JPA, a **proxy entity** is an object that serves as a placeholder for an actual entity. The proxy is generated by the JPA provider and can delay the loading of the entity's data until it is actually needed. This technique is known as **lazy loading**.

### Key Points:

- **Placeholder**: The proxy represents the entity without immediately loading its data from the database.
- **Lazy Initialization**: The actual entity data is fetched only when a method is called on the proxy that requires accessing the data.
- **Optimization**: This approach helps optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary database access until the data is explicitly needed.

### Example:

When `getReference()` is called, a proxy object is returned. Only when you try to access a property of the entity does the JPA provider fetch the data from the database.
