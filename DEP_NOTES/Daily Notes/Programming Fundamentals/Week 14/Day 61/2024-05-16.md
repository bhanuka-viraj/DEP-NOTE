| What is a design<br>system                                            | A design system  is a collection of reusable components<br> and clear standards that can be assembled together to build any number of applications. Design systems aid in digital product design and development of products such as mobile applications or websites.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| What is the advantage of design systems                               | Design systems are like a library of pre-built design components and guidelines that streamline the design and development process. This saves time and money, ensures consistent and high-quality products, and allows teams to collaborate more effectively. By promoting efficiency and organization, design systems can give businesses a significant competitive advantage.                                                        |

Typography -><br>Text related things<br><br>2.Iconography -><br>Icon related things<br><br>3.Colors -><br>All about colors. How colors behave in light mode,dark mode. Using universal colors (red for error, yellow for warnings, green for success)<br><br>4.Motions -><br>Motions and transition related things<br><br>5.Layout -><br>How does the design behave with screen size.
